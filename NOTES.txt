	run on Chester

	run on smic
		module add openmpi/1.8.4/INTEL-14.0.2 pgi/14.3

	1. switch to PGI fortran
	2. sanity check with pgfortran -acc. Verified by Jian
	2. profiling








Jian:


The HYPRE library installed on our local system is compiled with Intel compiler.
Although there is no compilation error the code generates NaNs when we ran it.
We are still looking into the problem.








Roberto Gomperts to Jian Tao:

Meanwhile have you looked into AmgX? I am cc:ing Nikolai from NVIDIA whao is
going to be at the Hackathon and has had some experience mapping Poisson
equations from HYPRE to AmgX.

These are Nikolai’s remarks:
HYPRE can be compiled with PGI but in general, I would recommend to use AmgX
API instead of HYPRE API. There are a lot of similarities between them so it
should be relatively easy to switch from HYPRE to AmgX. A typical API sequence
in AmgX is that you pass host or device pointers to matrix/rhs, specify solver
configuration, run setup/solve phases. AmgX supports standard CSR format for
matrices, for the configuration we would have to see what’s used in HYPRE and
mirror that using AmgX options. We also have an optimized configuration
specifically for the Poisson equation solver.
